    @IBAction func tupButton(sender: AnyObject) {
       performSegueWithIdentifier("show", sender: nil)
    }
    
       /*
    TODO one: Hook up a swipeable area on the home screen that must present a modal dialog when swiped. You must create the modal dialog and present it in CODE (not the storyboard).
    TODO two: Add an imageview to the modal dialog presented in TODO two.
    TODO three: Add and hook up a ‘dismiss’ button below the above mentioned image view that will dismiss the modal dialog. Do this in CODE.
    TODO four: Hook up the button on the home screen to push ArrayTableViewController into view (via the navigation controller) when tapped. Do this by triggering a segue from this view controller. The method you are looking for is performSegueWithIdentifier. Find the identifier from the storyboard.
